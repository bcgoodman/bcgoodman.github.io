                                Users (i.e. artists) are finding it time consuming and difficult to go out of their way to find new topics and appropriate references. At best they continue to draw, paint, and sculpt based on past influences, stagnating their growth as an artist, and some even choose not to practice. Our solution must provide users a randomly generated topic and appropriate reference materials.
